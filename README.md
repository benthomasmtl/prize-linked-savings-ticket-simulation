# Prize-linked Savings Simulation

This project simulates a prize-linked savings scenario, allowing you to explore the distribution of ticket matches and the odds of winning. The simulation is implemented in a Jupyter notebook with a modern, interactive interface.

## Features

- Interactive controls for all simulation parameters (number of users, mean/SD tickets per user, max ticket number)
- One-click "Save & Run Full Simulation" button to generate all results
- Bar chart of match distribution
- Summary table and statistics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd prize-linked-savings-ticket-simulation
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook prize-linked savings ticket simulation.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook `prize-linked savings ticket simulation.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Use the interactive widgets to set the number of users, mean and SD of tickets per user, and the max ticket number.
3. Click the green "Save & Run Full Simulation" button to run the simulation.
4. View the results:
   - A bar chart of ticket match distribution
   - A summary table of ticket match counts
   - Summary statistics for ticket counts
